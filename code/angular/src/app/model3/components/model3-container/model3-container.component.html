      <p>This model splits the portfolio into two allocations each with its own fixed annual growth rate.
        For example, we could have 80% of the portfolio in a <em>Growth</em> allocation (e.g. a global equity fund) at a mean growth rate of 5% a year,
        and 20% in a <em>Minimal Risk</em> allocation (e.g. GILTs), with a mean growth rate of 1% per year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The actual growth rate for each year is generated from a normal distribution, with the given mean and standard deviation. It's basically
        equivalent to the Excel formula <em>NORMINV(RAND(), mean, standardDeviation)</em>.
        A reasonable starting point for the standard deviation is 25%.
      </p>
      <p>
        In theory this method could result in a growth rate of less than -100%, which doesn't make sense, so I clip the growth rate at -99%.
