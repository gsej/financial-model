# pension-predictor
Implements the Lars Kroijer pension prediction spreadsheet but with code (removing need for Excel).

Spreadsheet Lars creates (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LUIQa5hgMg) is great, but does rely on a feature that seems to be only available in Excel (the datatables feature). This is hard (impossible?) to do in Libreoffice which I prefer as an excel user).
